Design a classic, premium website for the AI movie app Mood Movies.
Keep the landing/hero section minimal and elegant, but make the inner sections more lively, cinematic, and entertainment-focused using soft color accents (not neon, not oversaturated).

⭐ STYLE GUIDELINES

Landing page = clean, muted, Apple-like

Other sections = subtle cinematic colors inspired by film posters

Use rich but soft tones:

Deep blue, lavender, warm pink, muted purple, sunset orange

Very soft gradients, ambient glows

Keep everything premium, not playful

Cards should look modern, smooth, slightly vibrant

Add cinema-inspired accents: spotlight effects, soft film grain, subtle lighting

Avoid neon, avoid bright comic colors
